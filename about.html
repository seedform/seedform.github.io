                        <i>Hi there, how's it going?</i> In case you didn't understand the horrendously cheesy snippet of Java code 
                        up top (sorry for that), my name's Shudmanul Chowdhury. You might also know me as <i>Seedform</i> on GitHub, 
                        Google Play, and XDA.<br><br>
                        I'm a student, currently in my 2nd year of studying Computer Science at the University of Toronto, and on my 
                        way to completing the Specialist program.

                        Not very long ago, I became interested in web design, and that lead me to creating this site &#8211;
                        a place to showcase all my projects (and maybe a blog along with that at some point in the future). 
                        Feel free to look around. Almost everything I've made so far is open-source so that others may learn
                        small tricks and techniques through reading code as I have.
