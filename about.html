                            <i>Hi there, how's it going?</i> In case you didn't understand the horrendously cheesy snippet of Java code 
                            up top (sorry for that), my name is Shudmanul Chowdhury. You might also know me as <i>Seedform</i> on GitHub, 
                            Google Play, and XDA.
                        </p>

                            I'm a 2nd year student at the University of Toronto, currently pursuing an Honours B. Sc. in Computer Science
                            and on my way to completing the Specialist program-of-study.
                        </p>

                            My hunger for learning new things recently got the better of me and led me to creating this site &#8211; a 
                            place to showcase all my projects and experiment with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (and maybe a blog along 
                            with that at some point in the future).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I love Android &#8211; hacking, modding, and flashing all those great custom ROMs on countless devices. 
                            This is also why I've <i>developed</i> a love for <i>developing</i> Android applications and tinkering with 
                            every bit of the Android system.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am always learning on the job, so <i>stay tuned.</i>
                        </p>
